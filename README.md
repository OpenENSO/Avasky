# Avasky - BETA

---

Our service enables your business(or even your personal project!) to create passwordless, yet secure login methods to your resources by the use of Magic Links. This technology
further allows us to provide a means of verifying work/skill in a decentralized way, adding all these to a profile.

## What are Skylinks?

---

We are using a decentralized CDN platform called Skynet ( powered by Sia ) for storage and extended decentralized functionalities. As an example, we created a skapp called Skydrop, an add-on for the Avasky service which enables quick content sharing via skylinks.

The SDK empowered us to easily connect our application to Skynet and make use of a reliable and responsive platform.


## Magic Links

---

Magic Links offer an SDK for 'passwordless logins'. The service allows you to authenticate via email by verifying a certain link, as well as implement social and WebAuthn logins.

We use this service to authenticate users and grant access to specific resources given this information. The application is fully customizable and the UI as well UX
are kept at the same level of friendliness and fluidity.

## Further details

Avasky is an extensible, straightforward, customizable service for anyone seeking to make signing up/logging in an email away.

We kept the clutter away from the UI to deliver a fluid experience, focused on both user and business!

This project was created with awesomeness by Motanovici at the OpenENSO team for the SkyDB Debut Hackathon !
